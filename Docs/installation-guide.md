# SuperGemini Installation Guide 📦

## 🎯 It's Easier Than It Looks!

**The honest truth**: This guide looks long because we want to cover all the details, but installation is actually pretty simple. Most people are done in 2 minutes with one command! 

### Step 1: Install the Package

**Option A: From PyPI (Recommended)**
```bash
uv add SuperGemini
```

**Option B: From Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperGemini-Org/SuperGemini_Framework.git
cd SuperGemini_Framework
uv sync
```
### 🔧 UV / UVX Setup Guide

SuperGemini v3 also supports installation via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (a faster, modern Python package manager) or `uvx` for cross-platform usage.

### 🌀 Install with `uv`

Make sure `uv` is installed:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

> Or follow instructions from: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Once `uv` is available, you can install SuperGemini like this:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install SuperGemini
```

### ⚡ Install with `uvx` (Cross-platform CLI)

If you’re using `uvx`, just run:

```bash
uvx pip install SuperGemini
```

A comprehensive guide to installing SuperGemini v3. But remember - most people never need to read past the quick start above! 😊

## Before You Start 🔍

### What You Need 💻

SuperGemini works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**. Here's what you need:

**Required:**
- **Python 3.8 or newer** - The framework is written in Python

### Quick Check 🔍

Before installing, let's make sure you have the basics:

```bash
# Check Python version (should be 3.8+)
python --version

# See all available options
SuperGemini install --help

# Quick installation (recommended)
SuperGemini install --quick

# Want to see what would happen first?
SuperGemini install --quick --dry-run

# Install everything
SuperGemini install --profile developer

# Quiet installation (minimal output)
SuperGemini install --quick --quiet

# Force installation (skip confirmations)
python SuperGemini.py install --quick --force
```

### During Installation 📱

Here's what happens when you install:

1. **System Check** - Verifies you have required dependencies
2. **Directory Setup** - Creates `~/.gemini/` directory structure
3. **Core Files** - Copies framework documentation files
4. **Commands** - Installs slash command definitions (if selected)
5. **MCP Servers** - Downloads and configures MCP servers (if selected)
6. **Configuration** - Sets up `settings.json` with your preferences
7. **Validation** - Tests that everything works

The installer shows progress and will tell you if anything goes wrong.

## After Installation ✅

### Quick Test 🧪

Let's make sure everything worked:

```bash
# Check if files were installed
ls ~/.gemini/

# Should show: GEMINI.md, COMMANDS.md, settings.json, etc.
```

**Test with Gemini Code:**
1. Open Gemini Code
2. Try typing `/help` - you should see SuperGemini commands
3. Try `/analyze --help` - should show command options

### What Got Installed 📂

SuperGemini installs to `~/.gemini/` by default. Here's what you'll find:

```
~/.gemini/
├── GEMINI.md              # Main framework entry point
├── COMMANDS.md             # Available slash commands  
├── FLAGS.md                # Command flags and options
├── PERSONAS.md             # Smart persona system
├── PRINCIPLES.md           # Development principles
├── RULES.md                # Operational rules
├── MCP.md                  # MCP server integration
├── MODES.md                # Operational modes
├── ORCHESTRATOR.md         # Intelligent routing
├── settings.json           # Configuration file
└── commands/               # Individual command definitions
    ├── analyze.md
    ├── build.md
    ├── improve.md
    └── ... (13 more)
```

**What each file does:**
- **GEMINI.md** - Tells Gemini Code about SuperGemini and loads other files
- **settings.json** - Configuration (MCP servers, hooks, etc.)
- **commands/** - Detailed definitions for each slash command

### First Steps 🎯

Try these commands to get started:

```bash
# In Gemini Code, try these:
/sg:help                    # See available commands
/sg:analyze README.md       # Analyze a file
/sg:build --help           # See build options
/sg:improve --help         # See improvement options
```

**Don't worry if it seems overwhelming** - SuperGemini enhances Gemini Code gradually. You can use as much or as little as you want.

## Managing Your Installation 🛠️

### Updates 📅

Keep SuperGemini up to date:

```bash
# Check for updates
SuperGemini update

# Force update (overwrite local changes)
SuperGemini update --force

# Update specific components only
SuperGemini update --components core,commands

# See what would be updated
SuperGemini update --dry-run
```

**When to update:**
- When new SuperGemini versions are released
- If you're having issues (updates often include fixes)
- When new MCP servers become available

### Backups 💾

Create backups before major changes:

```bash
# Create a backup
SuperGemini backup --create

# List existing backups  
SuperGemini backup --list

# Restore from backup
SuperGemini backup --restore

# Create backup with custom name
SuperGemini backup --create --name "before-update"
```

**When to backup:**
- Before updating SuperGemini
- Before experimenting with settings
- Before uninstalling
- Periodically if you've customized heavily

### Uninstallation 🗑️

If you need to remove SuperGemini:

```bash
# Remove SuperGemini (keeps backups)
SuperGemini uninstall

# Complete removal (removes everything)
SuperGemini uninstall --complete

# See what would be removed
SuperGemini uninstall --dry-run
```

**What gets removed:**
- All files in `~/.gemini/` 
- MCP server configurations
- SuperGemini settings from Gemini Code

**What stays:**
- Your backups (unless you use `--complete`)
- Gemini Code itself (SuperGemini doesn't touch it)
- Your projects and other files

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues 🚨

**"Python not found"**
```bash
# Try python instead of python
python --version

# Or check if it's installed but not in PATH
which python
```

**"Gemini CLI not found"**
- Make sure Gemini Code is installed first
- Try `gemini --version` to verify
- Visit https://gemini.ai/code for installation help

**"Permission denied"**
```bash
# Try with explicit Python path
/usr/bin/python SuperGemini.py install --quick

# Or check if you need different permissions
ls -la ~/.gemini/
```

**"MCP servers won't install"**
- Check that Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check that npm is available: `npm --version`  
- Try installing without MCP first: `--minimal` or `--quick`

**"Installation fails partway through"**
```bash
# Try with verbose output to see what's happening
SuperGemini install --quick --verbose

# Or try a dry run first
SuperGemini install --quick --dry-run
```

### Platform-Specific Issues 🖥️

**Windows:**
- Use `python` instead of `python` if you get "command not found"
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator if you get permission errors
- Make sure Python is in your PATH

**macOS:**  
- You might need to approve SuperGemini in Security & Privacy settings
- Use `brew install python` if you don't have Python 3.8+
- Try using `python` explicitly instead of `python`

**Linux:**
- Make sure you have `python-pip` installed
- You might need `sudo` for some package installations
- Check that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH

SuperGemini install --profile developer --dev-hooks
```

## What's Next? 🚀

**Now that SuperGemini is installed (that was easy, right?):**

1. **Just start using it** - Try `/analyze some-file.js` or `/build` and see what happens ✨
2. **Don't stress about learning** - SuperGemini usually figures out what you need
3. **Experiment freely** - Commands like `/improve` and `/troubleshoot` are pretty forgiving
4. **Read guides if curious** - Check `Docs/` when you want to understand what just happened
5. **Give feedback** - Let us know what works and what doesn't

**The real secret**: SuperGemini is designed to enhance your existing workflow without you having to learn a bunch of new stuff. Just use it like you'd use regular Gemini Code, but notice how much smarter it gets! 🎯

**Still feeling uncertain?** Start with just `/help` and `/analyze README.md` - you'll see how non-intimidating it actually is.
