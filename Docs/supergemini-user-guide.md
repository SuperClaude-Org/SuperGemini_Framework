## The Three Operational Modes 🎭

SuperGemini operates in three distinct modes that optimize different aspects of the development workflow. Understanding these modes helps you get the most out of the framework.

### Task Management Mode 📋

**What it is**: Structured workflow execution with progress tracking and validation.

**When it's used**: Any multi-step operation that needs tracking and coordination.

**How it works**: SuperGemini breaks work into manageable tasks, tracks progress, and ensures quality through validation gates.

#### Four Layers of Task Management

**Layer 1: Session Tasks (TodoRead/TodoWrite)**
- **Scope**: Current Gemini Code session
- **Capacity**: 3-20 tasks per session
- **States**: pending 📋, in_progress 🔄, completed ✅, blocked 🚧
- **Usage**: Real-time progress tracking for immediate work

```bash
# SuperGemini usually creates and manages session tasks
/sg:build large-project/
# → Creates: "Analyze project structure", "Run build process", "Validate output"
```

**Layer 2: Project Tasks (/task command)**
- **Scope**: Multi-session features (days to weeks)
- **Structure**: Hierarchical (Epic → Story → Task)
- **Persistence**: Cross-session state management
- **Usage**: Long-term feature development

```bash
/sg:task create "implement user dashboard" --priority high
/sg:task breakdown "payment integration"
/sg:task status  # Check current project tasks
```

**Layer 3: Wave Orchestration**
- **Scope**: Complex multi-domain operations
- **Features**: Multi-stage execution with progressive enhancement
- **Usage**: System-wide improvements, comprehensive analysis

```bash
/sg:analyze system/ --wave-mode force --wave-strategy systematic
/sg:improve legacy-code/ --wave-mode auto
```

**Layer 4: Iterative Enhancement (/loop command)**
- **Scope**: Progressive refinement workflows
- **Features**: Iteration cycles with validation
- **Usage**: Quality improvement and refinement

```bash
/sg:improve messy-code.js --loop --iterations 3
# → Iteratively improves code with validation between cycles
```

#### Task State Management

**Core Principles**:
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: Measurable outcomes, not just activity
- **Single Focus Protocol**: Only one task in_progress at a time
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate status changes as work progresses
- **Quality Gates**: Validation before marking tasks complete

**Task Detection**:
- Multi-step operations (3+ steps) → Creates task breakdown
- Keywords: build, implement, create, fix, optimize → Activates task tracking
- Scope indicators: system, feature, comprehensive → Adds progress monitoring

### Introspection Mode 🧠

**What it is**: Meta-cognitive analysis that lets SuperGemini examine its own reasoning and decision-making processes.

**When it's used**: Complex problem-solving, framework troubleshooting, learning moments, or when you explicitly request it with `--introspect`.

**How it works**: SuperGemini steps outside normal operation to analyze its thinking patterns, decision logic, and action sequences.

#### Core Capabilities

**Reasoning Analysis** 🧠
- Examines logical flow and decision rationale
- Evaluates chain of thought coherence
- Identifies assumptions and potential biases
- Validates reasoning against evidence

**Action Sequence Review** 🔄
- Analyzes tool selection effectiveness
- Reviews workflow patterns and efficiency
- Considers alternative approaches
- Identifies optimization opportunities

**Framework Compliance Check** 🔍
- Validates actions against SuperGemini rules and principles
- Identifies deviations from standard patterns
- Provides corrective guidance when needed
- Ensures quality standards are met

**Learning Recognition** 💡
- Extracts insights from outcomes
- Identifies successful patterns for reuse
- Recognizes knowledge gaps for improvement
- Suggests future optimization strategies

#### Analysis Markers

When introspection mode is active, you'll see these markers:

- 🧠 **Reasoning Analysis** - Examining logical flow and decisions
- 🔄 **Action Sequence Review** - Analyzing workflow effectiveness
- 🎯 **Self-Assessment** - Meta-cognitive evaluation
- 📊 **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying behavioral patterns
- 🔍 **Framework Compliance** - Checking rule adherence
- 💡 **Retrospective Insight** - Learning from outcomes

#### When Introspection Activates

**Usually activates for**:
- Complex multi-step problems requiring meta-cognitive oversight
- Error recovery when outcomes don't match expectations
- Framework discussions or SuperGemini troubleshooting
- Pattern recognition needs for recurring behaviors

**Manual activation**:
```bash
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --introspect
/sg:troubleshoot "framework confusion" --introspection
```

### Token Efficiency Mode ⚡

**What it is**: Intelligent optimization system that maximizes information density while preserving quality.

**When it's used**: Large operations, when context approaches limits, or when you need faster execution.

**How it works**: Adaptive compression using symbols, abbreviations, and structural optimization based on context and persona awareness.

#### Compression Strategies

**5-Level Adaptive Compression**:
1. **Minimal** (0-40% usage): Full detail with persona-optimized clarity
2. **Efficient** (40-70% usage): Balanced compression with domain awareness  
3. **Compressed** (70-85% usage): Aggressive optimization with quality gates
4. **Critical** (85-95% usage): Maximum compression preserving essential context
5. **Emergency** (95%+ usage): Ultra-compression with information validation

#### Symbol System

**Core Logic & Flow**:
- `→` leads to, implies (`auth.js:45 → security risk`)
- `⇒` transforms to (`input ⇒ validated_output`)
- `&` and, combine (`security & performance`)
- `»` sequence, then (`build » test » deploy`)
- `∴` therefore (`tests fail ∴ code broken`)

**Status & Progress**:
- ✅ completed, passed
- ❌ failed, error  
- ⚠️ warning
- 🔄 in progress
- 🎯 target, goal

**Technical Domains**:
- ⚡ Performance
- 🔍 Analysis
- 🛡️ Security
- 📦 Deployment
- 🎨 Design

#### Activation Strategy

**Usually activates when**:
- Context usage >75% → Enables compression
- Large-scale operations → Prevents token overflow
- Complex orchestration → Optimizes communication

**Manual activation**:
```bash
/sg:analyze huge-codebase/ --uc  # Ultra-compressed mode
/sg:improve legacy-system/ --uc --wave-mode auto  # Efficient large operations
```

**Performance Goals** (still improving!):
- Target: ~30-50% token reduction
- Quality: Tries to preserve ~95% of information
- Speed: Usually <100ms compression decisions
- Integration: Works with framework components

#### Mode Integration

The three modes often work together:

```bash
/sg:improve large-legacy-system/ --wave-mode auto --uc --introspect
```

**What happens**:
- **Task Management**: Creates structured improvement plan with progress tracking
- **Token Efficiency**: Compresses output for large-scale operation
- **Introspection**: Analyzes improvement strategy and validates approach

## The Orchestrator System 🎯

The orchestrator is SuperGemini's intelligent routing system that tries to analyze your requests and coordinate a good combination of tools, personas, and integrations. It's what hopefully makes SuperGemini feel smart and responsive rather than just a collection of separate tools.

### How the Orchestrator Works 🔄

**Think of it as a smart dispatcher** that:
1. **Analyzes** your request to understand intent and complexity
2. **Routes** to the best combination of commands, flags, personas, and MCP servers
3. **Coordinates** execution for optimal results
4. **Validates** through quality gates to ensure good outcomes
5. **Optimizes** performance and resource usage

### Detection Engine 🧠

The detection engine analyzes every request through multiple lenses:

#### Pattern Recognition

**Complexity Detection**:
- **Simple**: Single file operations, basic tasks (<3 steps) → Direct execution
- **Moderate**: Multi-file operations, analysis tasks (3-10 steps) → Standard routing
- **Complex**: System-wide changes, architectural decisions (>10 steps) → Advanced orchestration

**Domain Identification**:
- **Frontend**: Keywords like "UI", "component", "responsive" → 🎨 frontend persona + Magic MCP
- **Backend**: Keywords like "API", "database", "service" → ⚙️ backend persona + Context7 MCP
- **Security**: Keywords like "vulnerability", "auth", "compliance" → 🛡️ security persona + Sequential MCP
- **Performance**: Keywords like "slow", "optimize", "bottleneck" → ⚡ performance persona + Playwright MCP

**Operation Type Classification**:
- **Analysis**: "analyze", "review", "understand" → Sequential MCP + analyzer persona
- **Creation**: "create", "build", "implement" → Magic MCP (if UI) or Context7 (patterns)
- **Modification**: "improve", "refactor", "optimize" → Appropriate specialist persona
- **Debugging**: "troubleshoot", "fix", "debug" → Sequential MCP + analyzer persona

#### Auto-Activation Logic

**High-Confidence Triggers** (90%+ activation):
```bash
/sg:analyze auth-system/ --focus security
# → 🛡️ security persona + Sequential MCP + --validate flag
```

**Context-Based Activation**:
```bash
/sg:build react-components/
# → 🎨 frontend persona + Magic MCP + --c7 flag (React docs)
```

**Performance-Based Activation**:
```bash
# When context usage >75%
/sg:analyze large-project/
# → Auto-adds --uc flag for compression
```

### Routing Intelligence 🚦

The routing system uses dynamic decision trees to map detected patterns to optimal tool combinations.

#### Master Routing Table

| Request Pattern | Usually Auto-Activates | How Often | Why |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-----|
| "analyze architecture" | 🏗️ architect + Sequential | Most times | Complex system analysis |
| "create UI component" | 🎨 frontend + Magic + --uc | Pretty often | Frontend domain with generation |
| "security audit" | 🛡️ security + Sequential | Most times | Security expertise needed |
| "debug complex issue" | 🔍 analyzer + Sequential | Often | Investigation methodology |
| "improve performance" | ⚡ performance + Playwright | Pretty often | Performance expertise + testing |

#### Intelligent Coordination

**Multi-Server Operations**:
```bash
/sg:design user-dashboard --type api
```
**Orchestrator usually coordinates**:
- 🏗️ architect persona (system design)
- 🎨 frontend persona (UI design) 
- Context7 MCP (framework patterns)
- Sequential MCP (design methodology)

**Fallback Strategies**:
- Context7 unavailable → WebSearch for documentation → Manual implementation
- Sequential timeout → Native Gemini analysis → Note limitations
- Magic failure → Basic component generation → Suggest manual enhancement

### Quality Gates & Validation Framework ✅

SuperGemini tries to implement an 8-step validation cycle for operations:

#### 8-Step Quality Process

1. **Syntax Validation** - Language parsers + Context7 standards
2. **Type Checking** - Sequential analysis + compatibility verification

#### Resource Management

**Token Allocation**:
- Detection Engine: 1-2K tokens for pattern analysis
- Decision Trees: 500-1K tokens for routing logic
- MCP Coordination: Variable based on activated servers
- Reserve: 10% buffer for unexpected complexity

**Operation Batching**:
- **Parallel execution** when no dependencies exist
- **Context sharing** across related operations
- **Cache strategies** for successful routing patterns
- **Smart queuing** to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Advanced Orchestration

**Sub-Agent Delegation**:
```bash
# Auto-activates when >7 directories or >50 files detected
/sg:analyze monorepo/
# → --wave-mode auto flag + systematic processing
```

**Wave Orchestration**:
```bash
# Auto-activates when complexity >0.7 + files >20 + operation types >2
/sg:improve legacy-system/
# → --wave-mode auto + multi-stage execution
```

## Rules & Principles 📏

SuperGemini operates according to core rules and principles that ensure consistent, reliable, and helpful behavior. Understanding these helps you predict how SuperGemini will approach problems and why it makes certain decisions.

### Core Operational Rules ⚖️

These are the core rules that SuperGemini tries to follow:

#### File Operation Security 🔐
- **Always Read before Write/Edit** - SuperGemini never modifies files without understanding current content
- **Use absolute paths only** - Prevents path traversal attacks and ensures reliable file operations
- **Never auto-commit** - SuperGemini won't commit changes to git unless explicitly requested
- **Prefer batch operations** - Multiple related changes are grouped for consistency

**Why this matters**: These rules prevent data loss, security vulnerabilities, and unintended modifications to your codebase.

#### Task Management Rules 📋
- **Evidence-based progress** - Tasks are only marked complete when there's measurable evidence
- **Single focus protocol** - Only one task is "in_progress" at a time for clarity
- **Quality gates** - All operations include validation steps before completion
- **Context retention** - Tries to preserve context well across operations

**Why this matters**: Ensures reliable progress tracking and prevents work from being lost or forgotten.

#### Framework Compliance Rules 🎯
- **Check dependencies first** - Always verify package.json/requirements.txt before using libraries
- **Follow existing patterns** - Respect project conventions, import styles, and architecture
- **Systematic codebase changes** - Complete discovery before making project-wide modifications
- **Validate completion** - Verify changes work and don't break existing functionality

**Why this matters**: Maintains code quality and consistency with your existing project structure.

### Development Principles 🛠️

/sg:analyze simple-file.js --no-mcp --answer-only
# → Minimal tooling for simple tasks

# Wrong persona activated
/sg:analyze backend-api/ --persona-security  
# → Override with explicit persona choice

# Not enough analysis depth
/sg:troubleshoot complex-issue --seq --all-mcp
# → Force maximum capabilities
```

#### Optimizing Coordination
```bash
# Start simple, add complexity as needed
/sg:analyze code.js                    # Basic analysis
/sg:analyze code.js --seq            # Add thinking
/sg:analyze code.js --seq --c7       # Add documentation
/sg:analyze code.js --seq --c7 --seq # Add systematic analysis
```

#### Understanding Coordination Decisions
```bash
# See why certain tools were chosen
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --introspect
# → Shows decision-making process and tool selection reasoning
```

### Best Practices for Integration 💡

#### Let Auto-Coordination Work First
- Trust SuperGemini's automatic tool selection
- Override only when you need specific perspectives
- Start with simple commands and add flags as needed

#### Understand Flag Interactions
- Some flags override others (`--no-mcp` overrides `--c7`, `--seq`)
- Safety flags take precedence over optimization flags
- Persona flags can be overridden by more specific persona requests

#### Use Appropriate Scope
- File-level: Single persona + minimal MCP
- Module-level: Domain personas + relevant MCP
- System-level: Multiple personas + full MCP coordination

#### Monitor Resource Usage
- Large operations → Use `--uc` and `--wave-mode`
- Simple tasks → Use `--no-mcp` and `--answer-only`
- Critical operations → Use `--safe-mode` and `--validate`

The key is understanding that SuperGemini's intelligence comes from the coordination between its components. The automatic coordination works well most of the time, but knowing how to control it gives you the flexibility to handle any situation.

## Tips & Best Practices 🎯

Based on real-world usage patterns and successful workflows, here are practical tips for getting the most out of SuperGemini.

### Starting Out Successfully 🚀

#### Begin with Simple Commands
```bash
# Start here - basic functionality
/sg:help
/sg:analyze README.md
/sg:build --help

# Not here - complex orchestration
/sg:improve entire-codebase/ --wave-mode force --all-mcp --wave-mode auto
```

**Why**: Understanding basic behavior before adding complexity prevents confusion and helps you learn the framework gradually.

#### Trust Auto-Activation First
```bash
# Let SuperGemini choose tools
/sg:analyze auth-system/  
# → Watch what auto-activates (likely security persona + validation)

# Then experiment with manual control
/sg:analyze auth-system/ --persona-performance
# → See different perspective on same code
```

**Why**: Auto-activation usually gets it right and shows you optimal tool combinations for different scenarios.

#### Use Preview and Safe Modes
```bash
# See what would happen first
/sg:improve messy-code.js --preview

# Apply changes safely  
/sg:improve messy-code.js --safe-mode

# For critical code, use both
/sg:improve production-auth/ --preview --safe-mode --validate
```

**Why**: Prevents unintended changes and helps you understand what SuperGemini will do before it does it.

### Flag Usage Patterns 🏁

#### Start Simple, Add Complexity
```bash
# Basic command
/sg:analyze complex-system/

# Add thinking if needed
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --seq

# Add documentation if external libraries involved
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --seq --c7

# Full analysis for critical systems
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --seq-hard --c7 --seq --validate
```

**Why**: Incremental complexity helps you understand what each flag adds and avoids over-engineering simple problems.

#### Common Flag Combinations That Work
```bash
# Safe improvement workflow
/sg:improve --preview → /improve --safe-mode → /test --coverage

# Deep investigation workflow  
/sg:troubleshoot issue --seq --seq → /analyze affected-code/ --focus quality

# Learning and documentation workflow
/sg:explain concept --persona-mentor --verbose --c7

# Performance optimization workflow
/sg:analyze --focus performance --persona-performance --play
```

**Why**: These combinations are proven patterns that work well together and don't conflict.

#### Avoid Flag Conflicts
```bash
# ❌ Conflicting flags
/sg:analyze code/ --no-mcp --c7  # --no-mcp overrides --c7

# ❌ Counterproductive combinations
/sg:analyze small-file.js --seq --all-mcp  # Overkill for simple tasks

# ✅ Sensible combinations
/sg:analyze large-system/ --seq --wave-mode auto  # Appropriate for complexity
/sg:analyze simple-utility.js --answer-only       # Appropriate for simplicity
```

**Why**: Understanding flag precedence and interactions prevents unexpected behavior and wasted resources.

### Persona Optimization 🎭

#### Let Domain Auto-Activation Work
```bash
# These will automatically get the right persona
/sg:build react-components/     # → frontend persona
/sg:scan auth/ --focus security # → security persona  
/sg:troubleshoot slow-api/      # → performance + analyzer personas
```

**Why**: Auto-activation is based on proven patterns and usually selects the most appropriate expertise.

#### Manual Override for Different Perspectives
```bash
# Get different viewpoints on same code
/sg:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-security    # Security perspective
/sg:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-performance # Performance perspective
/sg:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-architect   # Architecture perspective
```

**Why**: Different personas provide unique insights that can reveal issues or opportunities others might miss.

#### Use Appropriate Personas for Project Phases
```bash
# Planning phase
/sg:design new-feature --persona-architect

# Implementation phase  
/sg:build feature/ --persona-frontend  # or backend, etc.

# Testing phase
/sg:test feature/ --persona-qa

# Documentation phase
/sg:document feature/ --persona-scribe
```

**Why**: Each project phase benefits from different types of expertise and perspectives.

### MCP Server Strategy 🔧

#### Understand When Each Server Helps
- **Context7**: When working with frameworks, libraries, or need official documentation
- **Sequential**: For complex debugging, systematic analysis, or architectural decisions  
- **Magic**: For UI component generation, design systems, or frontend development
- **Playwright**: For testing, performance measurement, or browser automation

#### Optimize for Performance vs. Capabilities
```bash
# Fast execution for simple tasks
/sg:analyze simple-script.js --no-mcp

# Comprehensive analysis for complex problems
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --all-mcp --seq-hard

# Balanced approach for most work
/sg:analyze typical-component/ --c7  # Just documentation lookup
```

**Why**: Matching MCP usage to task complexity optimizes both speed and quality of results.

### Workflow Optimization 📈

#### Use Progressive Enhancement
```bash
# Level 1: Basic analysis
/sg:analyze component.js

# Level 2: Add thinking if complex
/sg:analyze component.js --seq

# Level 3: Add documentation for frameworks
/sg:analyze component.js --seq --c7

# Level 4: Full analysis for critical code
/sg:analyze component.js --seq-hard --c7 --seq --validate
```

**Why**: Start with what you need and add complexity only when necessary. Prevents over-engineering and saves time.

#### Batch Related Operations
```bash
# ✅ Efficient: Related operations together
/sg:analyze auth-system/ --focus security
/sg:improve auth-system/ --focus security --safe-mode  
/sg:test auth-system/ --type security

# ❌ Inefficient: Scattered operations
/sg:analyze auth-system/
/sg:review different-system/
/sg:improve auth-system/  # Context lost between operations
```

**Why**: Batching related work maintains context and allows SuperGemini to build on previous analysis.

#### Use Appropriate Scope
```bash
# File-level for specific issues
/sg:improve single-component.js --focus performance

# Module-level for related functionality
/sg:analyze user-auth/ --scope module

# Project-level for architectural concerns
/sg:analyze --scope project --focus architecture

# System-level only when necessary
/sg:analyze --scope system --wave-mode auto --uc
```

**Why**: Matching scope to problem prevents both under-analysis and resource waste.

### Performance and Efficiency 🏃‍♂️

#### Manage Context and Token Usage
```bash
# For large operations, use compression
/sg:analyze huge-codebase/ --uc --wave-mode auto

# For repeated analysis, cache results
/sg:load project-context/  # Cache project understanding
/sg:analyze specific-issue/  # Build on cached context

# For simple questions, minimize overhead
/sg:explain quick-concept --answer-only --no-mcp
```

**Why**: Token efficiency keeps operations fast and prevents context overflow in large projects.

#### Use Wave Mode for Large Projects
```bash
# Automatically activate wave mode for complexity
/sg:analyze monorepo/ --wave-mode auto

# Force wave mode for systematic analysis
/sg:analyze large-project/ --wave-mode force --wave-strategy systematic

# Disable wave mode for simple projects
/sg:analyze small-app/ --wave-mode off
```

**Why**: Wave orchestration provides better results (30-50%) for large-scale operations through multi-stage processing.

#### Optimize Command Sequences
```bash
# ✅ Efficient sequence
/sg:load project/           # Understand context once
/sg:analyze --focus quality # Build on understanding
/sg:improve --safe-mode     # Apply improvements
/sg:test --coverage         # Validate changes

# ❌ Inefficient sequence  
/sg:analyze file1.js
/sg:analyze file2.js        # Duplicate setup
/sg:analyze file3.js        # Lost optimization opportunities
```

**Why**: Sequential commands can build on each other's context and analysis for better results.

### Quality and Safety 🛡️

#### Always Validate Important Changes
```bash
# For production code
/sg:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode --validate --preview

# For experimental features
/sg:improve experimental-feature/ --validate

# For learning/exploration
/sg:improve test-code/ --preview  # See what it would do
```

**Why**: Validation prevents breaking changes and helps you understand the impact of modifications.

#### Use Quality Gates Effectively
```bash
# Let quality gates run automatically
/sg:build production-app/  # 8-step validation process runs

# Add extra validation for critical systems
/sg:build payment-system/ --validate --safe-mode

# Skip validation only for experimental work
/sg:build prototype/ --no-validate  # Use sparingly
```

**Why**: Quality gates catch issues early when they're cheaper and easier to fix.

#### Maintain Evidence Trail
```bash
# Commands that provide evidence
/sg:analyze --focus performance  # → Performance metrics
/sg:test --coverage             # → Coverage reports  
/sg:scan --focus security       # → Security assessment

# Use introspection for complex decisions
/sg:analyze complex-system/ --introspect  # → Decision reasoning
```

**Why**: Evidence-based development leads to better decisions and easier debugging when issues arise.

### Learning and Growth 📚

#### Use Mentor Persona for Learning
```bash
# Learn new concepts
/sg:explain GraphQL --persona-mentor --verbose

# Understand complex code
/sg:analyze complex-algorithm.js --persona-mentor

# Get step-by-step guidance
/sg:build new-feature/ --persona-mentor --plan
```

**Why**: Mentor persona optimizes for understanding and knowledge transfer rather than just task completion.

#### Experiment with Different Approaches
```bash
# Try different personas on same problem
/sg:analyze api-design/ --persona-architect
/sg:analyze api-design/ --persona-security
/sg:analyze api-design/ --persona-performance

# Compare tool combinations
/sg:build app/ --magic --c7
/sg:build app/ --no-mcp --uc  # Faster but simpler
```

**Why**: Understanding different approaches helps you choose the best tools for different situations.

#### Build Your Own Patterns
```bash
# Identify what works for your workflow
# Security-focused API development
/sg:design api --persona-security --validate
/sg:build api --persona-backend --c7
/sg:test api --type security --play

# Create your own efficient combinations
/sg:analyze code/ --seq --c7 --safe-mode  # Your personal "thorough analysis"
```

**Why**: Developing your own proven patterns increases productivity and ensures consistent quality.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

#### Don't Over-Engineer Simple Tasks
```bash
# ❌ Overkill for simple tasks
/sg:analyze simple-utility.js --seq --all-mcp --wave-mode force

# ✅ Appropriate for simple tasks  
/sg:analyze simple-utility.js --focus quality
```

#### Don't Ignore Auto-Activation Wisdom
```bash
# ❌ Fighting the system
/sg:build react-app/ --persona-backend --no-magic  # Wrong tools for the job

# ✅ Working with the system
/sg:build react-app/  # Let frontend persona and Magic activate automatically
```

#### Don't Skip Safety for Speed
```bash
# ❌ Risky for important code
/sg:improve production-auth/ --force --no-validate

# ✅ Balanced approach
/sg:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode --validate  # Safer but still efficient
```

#### Don't Use Flags You Don't Understand
```bash
# ❌ Cargo cult flag usage
/sg:command --random-flags-that-look-important

# ✅ Understand what each flag does
/sg:command --seq  # Because I need deeper analysis
/sg:command --c7     # Because I'm working with external libraries
```

### Measuring Success 📊

Track what works well for your specific needs:

- **Speed**: How quickly do different flag combinations complete?
- **Quality**: Which approaches produce better results for your type of work?
- **Learning**: Which combinations help you understand problems better?
- **Safety**: Which patterns prevent issues in your environment?

Remember: SuperGemini learns from successful patterns, so using effective combinations consistently helps the framework get better at auto-activation for your specific workflow.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues 🚨

When SuperGemini doesn't work as expected, here's how to diagnose and fix common problems.

### Command Issues 🛠️

#### Commands Not Working as Expected

**Problem**: Command produces unexpected results or seems to ignore your request.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what auto-activated
/sg:analyze code.js --introspect
# → Shows decision-making process

# Try with explicit control
/sg:analyze code.js --persona-analyzer --seq --seq
# → Override auto-activation
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be more specific about what you want
/sg:improve code.js --focus performance --safe-mode

# Use preview to understand what will happen
/sg:improve code.js --preview

# Start simple and add complexity
/sg:analyze code.js                    # Basic
/sg:analyze code.js --seq            # Add depth
/sg:analyze code.js --seq --c7       # Add documentation
```

**Common Causes**:
- Auto-activation chose different tools than you expected
- Request was too vague for SuperGemini to understand intent
- Complexity mismatch (simple request with complex flags or vice versa)

#### Commands Running Too Slowly

**Problem**: Operations take much longer than expected.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what's activated
/sg:analyze large-project/ --introspect
# → See what tools and servers are being used

# Monitor resource usage
/sg:analyze large-project/ --verbose
# → Shows detailed execution steps
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Optimize for speed
/sg:analyze large-project/ --uc --no-mcp --scope module

# Use delegation for large operations
/sg:analyze huge-codebase/ --wave-mode auto --concurrency 3

# Reduce scope
/sg:analyze specific-component.js  # Instead of entire project

# Disable expensive features
/sg:analyze code/ --no-mcp --answer-only
```

**Performance Optimization Priority**:
1. Reduce scope (`--scope file` vs `--scope project`)
2. Use compression (`--uc`)
3. Disable MCP servers (`--no-mcp`)
4. Use wave mode (`--wave-mode auto`)
5. Use answer-only mode (`--answer-only`)

#### Commands Producing Too Much Output

**Problem**: Information overload, hard to find relevant information.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use compression
/sg:analyze large-system/ --uc

# Be more specific about focus
/sg:analyze system/ --focus security  # Instead of general analysis

# Use answer-only for simple questions
/sg:explain concept --answer-only

# Limit scope
/sg:analyze --scope file specific-issue.js
```

### Flag Issues 🏁

#### Flag Conflicts and Unexpected Behavior

**Problem**: Flags don't seem to work or produce unexpected results.

**Common Conflicts**:
```bash
# ❌ These conflict
/sg:command --no-mcp --c7        # --no-mcp overrides --c7
/sg:command --answer-only --plan # --answer-only skips planning
/sg:command --uc --verbose       # --uc overrides --verbose

# ✅ These work together
/sg:command --seq --c7 --seq   # Complementary capabilities
/sg:command --safe-mode --validate --preview  # Layered safety
```

**Flag Precedence Order**:
1. Safety flags (`--safe-mode`) > optimization flags
2. Explicit flags > auto-activation  
3. `--no-mcp` overrides all individual MCP flags
4. Last specified persona wins
5. Scope: system > project > module > file

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what flags are actually active
/sg:command args --introspect
# → Shows final flag configuration after precedence resolution
```

#### Auto-Activation Issues

**Problem**: Wrong flags or personas auto-activate.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Override auto-activation explicitly
/sg:analyze frontend-code/ --persona-security  # Force security view
/sg:build project/ --no-mcp                    # Force native tools only

# Use more specific language
/sg:analyze "security vulnerabilities in auth system"  # Clear intent
# vs
/sg:analyze auth system                                # Ambiguous

# Check what keywords trigger auto-activation
/sg:help analyze  # Shows auto-activation patterns
```

**Auto-Activation Debugging**:
```bash
# See why certain flags activated
/sg:troubleshoot "why did --seq-hard activate?" --introspect
```

### Persona Issues 🎭

#### Wrong Persona Activated

**Problem**: SuperGemini uses the wrong specialist for your needs.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what triggered persona activation
/sg:analyze code/ --introspect
# → Shows persona selection reasoning
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Override with explicit persona
/sg:analyze backend-api/ --persona-security  # Security view of backend code
/sg:analyze ui-component/ --persona-performance  # Performance view of frontend

# Use more specific language
/sg:analyze "security issues in payment processing"  # Triggers security persona
/sg:analyze "slow database queries"                  # Triggers performance persona

# Try different personas for different perspectives
/sg:analyze payment-system/ --persona-security    # Security view
/sg:analyze payment-system/ --persona-architect   # Architecture view
```

#### Persona Doesn't Seem Active

**Problem**: Expected persona behavior but getting generic responses.

**Check Persona Activation**:
```bash
# Verify persona is active
/sg:analyze auth/ --persona-security --introspect
# → Should show security-focused reasoning

# Check if domain keywords are clear
/sg:scan authentication --focus security  # Should auto-activate security persona
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be explicit about persona and focus
/sg:analyze code/ --persona-security --focus security

# Use appropriate commands for personas
/sg:scan --persona-security     # Security scanning
/sg:test --persona-qa           # Quality-focused testing
/sg:document --persona-scribe   # Professional documentation
```

### MCP Server Issues 🔧

#### MCP Servers Not Activating

**Problem**: Expected MCP capabilities but they don't seem to work.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check MCP server status
/sg:troubleshoot "MCP servers not working" --introspect

# Verify MCP installation
/sg:load --summary  # Should show available MCP servers

# Test specific servers
/sg:analyze react-app/ --c7     # Should use Context7
/sg:troubleshoot issue --seq    # Should use Sequential
/sg:build ui/ --magic           # Should use Magic
/sg:test app/ --play            # Should use Playwright
```

**Common Solutions**:
```bash
# Force MCP activation
/sg:analyze code/ --all-mcp

# Check if servers are disabled
/sg:analyze code/ --c7  # If this doesn't work, Context7 may be unavailable

# Use fallback approaches
/sg:analyze react-app/ --no-mcp  # Use native tools if MCP unavailable
```

#### MCP Servers Too Slow

**Problem**: MCP server integration causes slow performance.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Disable MCP for speed
/sg:analyze large-project/ --no-mcp

# Use selective MCP activation
/sg:analyze react-code/ --magic --no-seq  # Only UI generation, skip analysis

# Optimize MCP usage
/sg:analyze code/ --uc --c7  # Compression + documentation only
```

### Performance Issues ⚡

#### Operations Using Too Many Tokens

**Problem**: Hitting context limits or expensive operations.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enable compression automatically
/sg:analyze huge-project/ --uc

# Reduce scope
/sg:analyze --scope module specific-area/
/sg:analyze --scope file specific-file.js

# Use delegation
/sg:analyze large-codebase/ --wave-mode auto --uc

# Disable expensive features
/sg:analyze code/ --no-mcp --answer-only
```

#### Memory or Resource Issues

**Problem**: Operations failing or very slow due to resource constraints.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reduce concurrency
/sg:analyze large-project/ --wave-mode auto --concurrency 1

# Use safe mode
/sg:improve large-system/ --safe-mode  # More conservative resource usage

# Break work into smaller chunks
/sg:analyze module1/
/sg:analyze module2/
/sg:analyze module3/
# Instead of /analyze entire-project/
```

### Quality and Safety Issues 🛡️

#### Unsafe or Risky Suggestions

**Problem**: SuperGemini suggests changes that seem risky.

**Always Use Safety Features**:
```bash
# Preview before applying
/sg:improve important-code/ --preview

# Use safe mode for critical code
/sg:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode

# Add validation
/sg:improve system/ --validate --safe-mode

# Use iterative approach
/sg:improve complex-system/ --loop --safe-mode
```

#### Changes Breaking Functionality

**Problem**: Applied improvements cause issues.

**Prevention**:
```bash
# Always use preview first
/sg:improve code/ --preview

# Use safe mode
/sg:improve code/ --safe-mode

# Test after changes
/sg:improve code/ --safe-mode && /test code/
```

**Recovery**:
- Use git to revert changes
- Apply improvements incrementally with `--safe-mode`
- Use `--validate` to check before applying changes

### Framework and Integration Issues 🔗

#### SuperGemini Doesn't Understand Project Context

**Problem**: Recommendations don't fit your project's patterns or constraints.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Load project context first
/sg:load --deep --summary

# Be explicit about project type
/sg:analyze react-typescript-app/ --c7  # Include tech stack in description

# Use appropriate personas
/sg:analyze node-api/ --persona-backend
/sg:analyze react-ui/ --persona-frontend
```

#### Inconsistent Results

**Problem**: Same command produces different results at different times.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what's auto-activating differently
/sg:command args --introspect

# Use explicit flags for consistency
/sg:analyze code/ --persona-analyzer --seq --c7  # Explicit configuration
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be more explicit about requirements
/sg:improve code/ --focus performance --persona-performance --safe-mode

# Use consistent flag patterns
/sg:analyze --seq --c7     # Your standard thorough analysis
/sg:improve --safe-mode      # Your standard safe improvement
```
