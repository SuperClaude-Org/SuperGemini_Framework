# SuperGemini Agents Guide ü§ñ

## Overview

SuperGemini V4 Beta features 13 specialized domain expert agents that automatically activate based on your task context. These intelligent agents replace the previous persona system with more advanced, focused capabilities that provide expert-level assistance across all aspects of software development.

**The simple truth**: You don't need to pick agents or memorize what they do. SuperGemini automatically brings in the right experts for each situation!

**Here's what actually happens:**
- You type `/analyze auth.js` ‚Üí Security auditor automatically jumps in üõ°Ô∏è
- You work on React components ‚Üí Frontend specialist often takes over üé®  
- You debug performance issues ‚Üí Performance optimizer often helps ‚ö°
- You write documentation ‚Üí Technical writer usually helps out ‚úçÔ∏è

**It's like having a smart team** that knows when to jump in and help, without you managing who does what.

## üöÄ Just Try These (No Agent Knowledge Required)

```bash
# These automatically activate the right experts:
/sg:analyze payment-system/         # ‚Üí Security + backend experts auto-activate
/sg:build react-app/               # ‚Üí Frontend specialist takes over  
/sg:improve slow-queries.sql       # ‚Üí Performance optimizer jumps in
/sg:troubleshoot "auth failing"    # ‚Üí Root cause analyzer + security expert coordinate
/sg:document api-system/          # ‚Üí Technical writer creates documentation
```

**See the pattern?** You focus on what you want to do, SuperGemini figures out who should help.

```

## Best Practices üí°

### Getting Started (The Simple Way)
1. **Just use normal commands** - Agents auto-activate based on your needs
2. **Trust the automation** - SuperGemini usually picks better experts than manual selection
3. **Focus on your work** - Not on managing which agent helps you
4. **Let coordination happen** - Multiple agents work together automatically

### Advanced Usage (When You Want Control)
1. **Manual agent selection** - Use agent names in commands when you want specific expertise
2. **Cross-domain perspectives** - Ask security agents about frontend code for different viewpoints
3. **Learning mode** - Use code-educator for explanation-focused assistance
4. **Quality focus** - Combine qa-specialist with domain experts for comprehensive quality

### Common Patterns

**For New Projects**:
```bash
/sg:design "your project idea"      # ‚Üí System architecture and planning
# ‚Üí Automatic technical specification
# ‚Üí Ready for implementation workflow
```

**For Existing Code**:
```bash
/sg:analyze existing-system/        # ‚Üí Appropriate domain expert auto-selected
/sg:improve --focus quality code/   # ‚Üí Quality-focused agent coordination
/sg:secure legacy-application/      # ‚Üí Security-focused analysis and hardening
```

**For Learning**:
```bash
/sg:explain complex-concept --educational  # ‚Üí Code educator with domain expert
/sg:document api/ --audience beginner     # ‚Üí Technical writer with appropriate level
```

## Final Notes üìù

**The real truth about agents** üíØ:
- **Auto-activation works remarkably well** - Usually better than trying to pick experts yourself
- **You can completely ignore agent details** and still get excellent expert assistance
- **Agents exist to help you** - Not to create complexity you need to manage
- **Learning happens naturally** through use, not through studying agent descriptions

**Don't feel overwhelmed by the team** üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
- You don't need to know what each agent does
- SuperGemini handles expert selection intelligently
- The detailed descriptions above are for curiosity, not necessity
- Focus on your work - the right experts will show up when needed

**When you might want to know about agents**:
- **Curiosity** - "What would a security expert think about this frontend code?"
- **Learning** - "How would different experts approach this problem?"
- **Specialization** - "I specifically need Python architecture expertise"
- **Quality focus** - "I want comprehensive quality analysis from multiple angles"

**Keep it simple** üéØ:
- Use normal commands like `/analyze some-code/` and `/build my-app/`
- Let the right experts automatically show up
- Agent coordination is available when you want it, not because you need it
- Focus on building great software - we'll handle the expertise coordination
