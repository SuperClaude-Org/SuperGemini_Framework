# SuperGemini AI Personas Guide 🤖

## Overview

SuperGemini employs 13 specialized AI personas through Gemini CLI's Persona Mode. Unlike sub-agents, the Gemini CLI directly adopts these expert roles, providing specialized knowledge and capabilities based on task context and keywords.

**Persona Mode Activation**: Type `/sg:implement "secure user login"` and watch as Gemini CLI adopts the security-engineer persona, providing specialized security expertise directly.

**Persona Intelligence**: Gemini CLI seamlessly switches between personas or combines their expertise for complex tasks, providing comprehensive domain knowledge without creating separate agents.

## 🚀 Just Try These (No Agent Knowledge Required)

**Persona Mode Examples:**
```bash
# Activates: security-engineer persona
/sg:implement "JWT authentication with rate limiting"

# Activates: frontend-architect persona
/sg:design "responsive dashboard with accessibility"

# Activates: devops-architect persona
/sg:troubleshoot "slow deployment pipeline"

# Activates: qa-specialist persona
/sg:test "payment processing security"
```

**Pattern Recognition Logic:**
- **Keywords**: "auth", "security" → security-engineer
- **File types**: ".jsx", ".vue" → frontend-architect
- **Context**: API endpoints → backend-architect
- **Complexity**: Multi-domain tasks → Combined persona expertise

## Agent Coordination & Integration 🤝

**Agent Collaboration Patterns:**

**Full-Stack Development**: frontend-architect + backend-architect + security-engineer
**Quality Assurance**: quality-engineer + performance-engineer + security-engineer
**System Design**: system-architect + devops-architect + performance-engineer
**Problem Solving**: root-cause-analyst + performance-engineer + security-engineer

**Multi-Domain Coordination:**
Complex projects automatically activate multiple agents based on scope and requirements. Agents coordinate through shared context and complementary expertise.

**MCP Server Integration:**
- **Context7**: Provides domain-specific patterns and documentation
- **Sequential**: Enables systematic multi-step reasoning
- **Magic**: Enhances UI/UX capabilities for frontend agents
- **Playwright**: Enables browser automation for testing agents
- **Morphllm**: Accelerates code transformation for refactoring agents
- **Serena**: Provides project memory and context for all agents

**Command Integration:**
Each SuperGemini command automatically selects appropriate agents:
- `/sg:implement` → domain-specific architects (frontend, backend, security)
- `/sg:analyze` → quality-engineer + security-engineer + performance-engineer
- `/sg:troubleshoot` → root-cause-analyst + domain specialists
- `/sg:improve` → refactoring-expert + performance-engineer
- `/sg:document` → technical-writer + domain specialists

## Best Practices 💡

**Getting Started (Simple Approach):**
1. **Start Simple**: Just describe what you want - agents activate automatically
2. **Trust the System**: SuperGemini selects the right experts for your context
3. **Learn from Patterns**: Notice which agents activate for different tasks
4. **Gradual Complexity**: Add more detail to trigger additional specialist agents

**Advanced Agent Control:**
- **Cross-Domain Projects**: Combine keywords to trigger multiple agents
- **Specific Expertise**: Use domain-specific terminology for targeted activation
- **Quality Focus**: Include "security", "performance", "quality" for comprehensive coverage
- **Learning Mode**: Add "explain" or "tutorial" to include educational perspective

**Common Usage Patterns:**

**New Project Startup:**
```bash
/sg:analyze "fintech mobile app project"
# → Activates: system-architect + frontend-architect + security-engineer
```

**Existing Code Analysis:**
```bash
/sg:analyze src/ --focus security
# → Activates: security-engineer + quality-engineer + refactoring-expert
```

**Learning & Understanding:**
```bash
/sg:explain "microservices architecture patterns"
# → Activates: system-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer
```

**Performance Investigation:**
```bash
/sg:troubleshoot "API response time > 2 seconds"
# → Activates: performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst + backend-architect
```

**Quality Improvement:**

## Final Notes 📝

**The Truth About Agent Usage:**

SuperGemini agents activate automatically based on keywords and context - you don't need to manage them. The system is designed to be sophisticated under the hood while remaining simple to use.

**Agent Knowledge Usefulness:**
- **Useful**: Understanding why certain agents activate can help you craft better commands
- **Useful**: Knowing agent specialties helps you choose the right keywords and approaches
- **Unnecessary**: Manual agent selection or micromanagement - the system handles this
- **Unnecessary**: Memorizing all agent capabilities - the system routes intelligently

**Simple Usage Approach:**
1. **Focus on Your Goal**: Describe what you want to accomplish clearly
2. **Use Natural Language**: Include domain keywords naturally ("security", "performance", "UI")
3. **Trust the System**: Let SuperGemini activate appropriate agents automatically
4. **Learn from Results**: Notice which agents activate and why, but don't force it
